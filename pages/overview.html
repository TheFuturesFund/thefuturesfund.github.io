  <h1>Overview</h1>

  <p>
    The Futures Fund is a workforce development program designed with the mission to create digital, literary, visual, and performing arts-based entrepreneurial opportunities for middle to high school aged youth. It provides students with training in the arts under the guidance of paid professionals and volunteers with industry-specific expertise. Our Saturday training programs are research-driven, and based on best practices to prepare creative-minded youth for revenue-generating opportunities in their selected arts discipline. In this second year of operation, we continue to offer two of the four disciplines – digital and visual arts. 
  </p>

  <p>
    Our hope is that this program helps your child learn new skills, build confidence in his or her artistic abilities – either in computer science or photography – and hear directly from entrepreneurs that can help inform your child’s future goals. Even more, this new knowledge, skills and experience can help position your child for internship and job opportunities in the ever-growing arts and engineering community here in Baton Rouge!

  <p>  
    The Futures Fund will equip students with digital and visual art and entrepreneurial skills during the eight-week course. Active participation will result in students' ability to articulate the importance of coding or photography, while empowering them to apply these skills in the business world. Students will also engage with business professionals before and after class instruction to develop the 21st century workforce skills necessary to compete in today's business world.

    This direct introduction to revenue-generating opportunities is what sets The Futures Fund apart from other programs. Our students have been hired to take photos at events, community members have purchased their photographs, and the City of Baton Rouge has selected coding interns for the summer.
