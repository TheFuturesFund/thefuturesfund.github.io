  <h1>Overview</h1>

  <p>
    <em>Preparing Louisiana Youth for Arts and Technology Based Jobs.</em> The Futures Fund is an initiative spun out of The Walls Project to catalyze economic development and neighborhood revitalization in high-need communities. A workforce development program designed with the mission to create digital, literary, visual, and performing arts-based entrepreneurial opportunities for youth 14-18 years old. Through our efforts, traditionally impoverished areas have the opportunity to emerge as regional entrepreneurial hubs by more effectively activating the talent in those communities, taking advantage of expanding industries such as technology and leveraging these activities for community revitalization.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Futures Fund runs a training program and connects students to revenue-generating opportunities or to individuals that can model the pathway to such opportunities, focused on digital and visual arts. The program focuses on middle to high school students that face struggles associated with high poverty rates. Students are taught by paid professionals every Saturday over eight-weeks, learning critical 21st century skills including critical thinking, problem solving, and money management in addition to the hard content-specific skills. These competencies are needed for one to succeed; these are also the skills employers and educational institutions say are now severely lacking among graduates.

  <p>
    The Futures Fund provides FREE Saturday programming for youth to learn skills in the creative arts under the guidance of paid professionals and volunteers. Students are expected to attend all sessions for the instruction is oered in a lock step manner over the course of the program. After completing our training programs, youth will be directed to paid opportunities to demonstrate mastery of their arts discipline. Our programming is research-driven and based on best practices from award-winning regional, national, and international organizations that prepare creative-minded individuals to create their own revenue-generating products and services. To accomplish this mission weâ€™ve brought together a diverse team of industry experts, community leaders, and educators.
